IAPWSPy
=======

IAPWSPy is a python package that allows to manipulate thermophysical properties of water, thanks to the IAPWS-95 (International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam : http://www.iapws.org/) experimental correlations. All correlations are currently based on the saturated properties of water and package allow to draw some usual thermodynamical diagrams (Mollier, Clapeyron,...).
